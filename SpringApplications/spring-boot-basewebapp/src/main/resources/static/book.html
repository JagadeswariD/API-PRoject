	<p class="intro">

		Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle
		the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are
		students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord
		<span>Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as
			the</span>
		Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
	</p>

	<p>
		The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the
		United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1] A series of many genres,
		including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of
		mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and
		includes many cultural meanings and references.[2] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[3] Other major
		themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[4]

		Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have
		found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult
		audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature.[5][6] As of
		February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book
		series in history, and have been translated into more than eighty languages.[7] The last four books
		consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7
		million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its
		release.
